❄️ Snowflake ChatGPT Analysis

A data engineering and analytics project demonstrating end-to-end data processing in Snowflake, combined with Python automation for analysis and export.

This project showcases how to: 
1.Create and manage Snowflake databases, schemas, and warehouses

2.Load CSV data into Snowflake using SQL commands

3.Run analytical queries and transformations

4.Automate data extraction using Python and the Snowflake Connector
